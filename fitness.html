  First Step: To think about what you want to achieve with your whole being. Set some nutrition or fitness goals for yourself. Doesn't have to be that many. Maybe 1, maybe 6, however many you want.
  
  Second Step: When you're finished with your goals, think about what you want to do that will make those goals be achieved. Set up a nutrition plan or a workout routine you want to do. Always wanna make sure you are prepared.
  
  Third Step: Once you're finished getting set up and prepared, start what you planned the very next day. The quicker you start, the faster you'll get to getting that summer bod ;)
  
  Fourth Step: Once you get started, you won't be able to stop. It will become a habit as long as you keep up with what you have. Once it becomes a habit, you will find it to be good for you and grow to like it even.
  
  Fifth Step: Always make sure you are having fun. If you are not and you're just forcing yourself to do it, that is not healthy for you in the long run. Make sure to always have fun!!!
